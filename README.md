## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You will need to download Stackoverflowâ€™s 2017 and 2018 Annual Developer Survey and put in specific folders. You can find the data to download here.[here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 AND 2018  data to better understand:

1.What are the most used programming languages in INDIA?
2.What are the most wanted programming languages in INDIA?
3.How does programming languages used at work relates with programming languages people want to learn?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

**write a blog post.ipynb: Notebook containing the data analysis.**

**survey_results_public.csv: Stackoverflow's 2017 Annual Developer Survey data.**

**survey_results_public18.csv: Stackoverflow's 2018 Annual Developer Survey data.**

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@dipanjanoffcial369/which-is-the-best-programming-language-to-learn-in-india-819cf31da547).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
